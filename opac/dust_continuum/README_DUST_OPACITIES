For dust continuum radiative transfer RADMC-3D requires dust opacities,
which are typically given in tabulated form as a function of wavelength (one
line per wavelength point). For each wavelength point the absorption opacity
(kappa_abs in units of cm^2/gram-of-dust) and the scattering opacity
(kappa_scat in units of cm^2/gram-of-dust) is given, and perhaps also some
information about the scattering phase function.

Some of these opacity tables can be downloaded directly from the web, but
usually the web databases give merely the "optical constants" of the
material. To convert these into opacity tables requires some more software.
Things are explained more deeply in the sub-directories.
