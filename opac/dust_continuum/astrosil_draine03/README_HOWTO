Create the "astronomical silicate" opacity of Draine (2003), which is the
successor of the opacity of Laor & Draine (1993).
If you use this, please cite this paper.

Manual:

First edit the example_radmc3d_opacities.py file to choose the grain
size and some of the other adjustable parameters. See the directory
bohrenhuffman_python/ and its README file for more details.

Then:

 python example_radmc3d_opacities.py

This will create the file

 dustkapscatmat_astrosilicate_draine03.inp

To make some plots:

 python plot_opacity.py
