Create the opacity for a mix of silicate (pyroxene) and carbon grains. The
mixing is done in an oversimplified way: simply averaging by weight the opacites
for each of the species. This is very crude, and likely to be incorrect for
aggregated dust grains (because when dust coagulates, it will not form
silicate-only and carbon-only grains, but mixed aggregates). But given that
it is extremely hard to compute the opacities for such mixed aggregates
self-consistently (and given that Mie theory cannot handle complex aggregates
anyway), this simple mass-weighted averaging is a reasonable thing to do.
In fact, the mixing of the opacities in this way means that the constituents
are (must be) in thermal contact, because by averaging opacities the grains
of the different constituents will automatically have the same temperature.

If you want to allow these different species of dust to have their own individual
temperatures (temperature decoupling), then you must use them as separate
opacities and separate dust components in your model.

In this simple mixing example we use pyroxene and amorphous carbon. The optical
constants are from:

Pyroxene:
Jaeger, Mutschke, Begemann, Dorschner, Henning (1994) A&A 292, 641-655.

Amorphous Carbon:
Preibisch, Ossenkopf, Yorke and Henning (1993) A&A 279, 577.

Manual:

First edit the example_radmc3d_opacities.py file to choose the grain size, the
mixing ratio, and some of the other adjustable parameters. See the directory
bohrenhuffman_python/ and its README file for more details.

Then:

 python example_radmc3d_opacities.py

This will create the files

 dustkapscatmat_pyroxene_amorph_mg70_jaeger94.inp
 dustkapscatmat_carbon_amorph_preibisch93.inp     
 dustkapscatmat_mix.inp

To make some plots of the mix:

 python plot_opacity.py
