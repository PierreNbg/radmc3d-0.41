Here we do the protoplanetary disk model tests of Pinte et al. 2009. The
test is described in the paper

   Pinte, C.; Harries, T.J.; Min, M.; Watson, A.M.; Dullemond, C.P.; Woitke,
   P.; Menard, F.; Duran-Rojas, M.C. (2009) "Benchmark problems for
   continuum radiative transfer. High optical depths, anisotropic
   scattering, and polarisation." A&A, 498(3), 967â€“980. 

and all the files and comparisons can be downloaded from the following 
website:

Both the isotropic scattering tests and the full polarized scattering
tests are done. 

The agreement of the temperature profiles with those of MCFOST is good. 
In particular the agreement for the isotropic scattering cases are perfect.
This is not surprising because the predecessor of RADMC-3D (called RADMC)
was one of the codes participating in this benchmark, albeit only for the
isotropic scattering case. 

With RADMC-3D now also the full polarized anisotropic scattering case can be
compared to the benchmark. For the three highest optical depth cases (dust
masses of 3E-5, 3E-6 and 3E-7 Msun) the agreement is very good, nearly
perfect (apart from noise). But interestingly for the lowest disk mass (3E-8
Msun), which has a radial optical depth of only 1E3, there are some small
differences. That is a bit puzzling, because the more optically thick cases
are numerically harder! Since the agreement on the harder problems is very
good, I for now consider this test passed. But as a TODO I should figure out
if this difference is real or due to a misunderstanding.
