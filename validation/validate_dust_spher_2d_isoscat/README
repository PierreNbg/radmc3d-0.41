Here I compare multiple scattering against single scattering for a disklike
geometry. Also I compare single scattering Monte Carlo with simple single
scattering. The single scattering Monte Carlo still includes all physics such as
thermal dust emission as a source of scattered light, finite size star
(optional), and multiple stellar sources. But the simple single scattering
(command-line option "simplescat") is directer and does not use Monte Carlo.
Is therefore has no Monte Carlo noise.

This spawns 5 figures. As you can see, the single scattering and simple
single scattering images are virtually identical. That shows that the
simple single scattering mode works (at least for isotropic scattering).

The full scattering image is, however, subtantially different. It is brighter,
and the surface layer is vertically more extended (mostly downward into the
disk). This is because of the high albedo of the dust: kappa_scat / ( kappa_abs
+ kappa_scat ) = 0.686, or in other words: kappa_scat/kappa_abs=2.2. Multiple
scattering is therefore prominent. This also explains the much brighter disk.
