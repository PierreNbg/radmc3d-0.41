To see the effect of forward-peaked scattering, we make here an optically thin
ring. Please note that the density of the ring is chosen simply to make the
optical depth ultra-thin, not because of any physical reason.  The optical
thinness means that we can safely assume single scattering. We use the simple
single scattering mode, which is much (!) faster than the scattering Monte
Carlo. It was checked (similar to validate_dust_spher_2d_fullscat/) that the
simple scattering mode gives the same results as single scattering Monte Carlo.

We view the ring from an inclination of 55 degrees from face-on. 

Manual:

  python problem_setup.py
  radmc3d mctherm
  python plot_compare_isoaniso.py

You can see from the two images that the isotropic scattering case yields
a ring that is symmetric top-bottom. But it has two ansae left-right because
of the path-length effect (limb brightening). For the anisotropic case you
see that the near side (bottom) is clearly brighter than the far side (top).
This is the scattering phase function effect: the fact that the scattering
is forward-peaked. 

By doing

  python plot_opacity.py

you can see this phase function (we are at 0.5 micron, so the green curve).
