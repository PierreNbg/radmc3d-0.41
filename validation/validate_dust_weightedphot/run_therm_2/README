Here the second star is smoothed out using the stellar source function
method (which is useful for modeling Galaxies for instance). Also here the
weighted and unweighted cases are the same. And if you make the width of the
"smoothed out star" very narrow, then it converges to the result for a point
source star (as in run_1). So that suggests that the results for the stellar
source function are ok.
