Here we test the thermal dust emission. I put the optical depth
to a high value.

Here you clearly see the importance of the weighted photons. The 
unweighted photon result is completely noisy. That is because the
total luminosity is dominated by the star by a vast amount. The 
dust luminosity is small, but the radiation dominates nonetheless,
because of the optical depth.
