Here I test a simple dark cloud irradiated from outside by a NON-DILUTED
blackbody. This must show that the middle of the cloud has the same
temperature as the outside, in spite of non-trivial optical depth. 

The result is as expected: The temperature is everywhere the same as
the optically thin temperature.
