Here we test the external source. 

NOTE: I stumbled over a phenomenon that at first sight looks strange: the
mean intensity due to the external source sometimes appears to be
overestimated by RADMC-3D. The reason (I found out) is that if the
wavelength is not exactly one of the values in wavelength_micron.inp the
background intensity is interpolated linearly. If you are, however, deep in
the Wien tail of the Planck function, then this linear interpolation can
overestimate the flux by quite some amount (I found a factor of 2
sometimes). However, in the current example it is not a problem.
