Here I test a simple dark cloud irradiated from outside by a diluted
blackbody. I compare the temperature against the optically thin
temperature. I do not run both the weighted and unweighted photons, because
they produce the same (we now have only one source: the external source).

The result is as expected: on the outside it matches the optically thin
temperature, but at the inside the temperature is cooler.
