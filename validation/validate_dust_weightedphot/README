Here I test RADMC-3D dust continuum thermal Monte Carlo with weighted
photons mode and compare it against the unweighted photons mode. Also the
results are compared to analytic calculations as much as possible.  So this
validation directory also validates the various emission sources in the
Monte Carlo model, both for the thermal Monte Carlo and for the monochromatic
Monte Carlo. The latter is the MC used for the scattering (and thus for
the images and spectra), but here we test the mean intensity field directly
using the "mcmono" command. 

In the unweighted photon mode the brighter sources will launch more photon
packages than the less bright ones. In the weighted photon mode, each source
emits an equal number of photon packages, but these photon packages have
then different energies to compensate this.

First the thermal Monte Carlo runs:

  run_therm_1:  Two-star setup
  run_therm_2:  One star and a gaussian "stellar source" cloud
  run_therm_3:  One star and an external radiation field
  run_therm_4:  A dark cloud with external diluted blackbody
  run_therm_5:  A dark cloud with external non-diluted blackbody

Then the monochromatic Monte Carlo runs:

  run_mcmono_1: Two-star setup
  run_mcmono_2: One star and a gaussian "stellar source" cloud
  run_mcmono_3: One star and an external radiation field
  run_mcmono_4: One star and thermal dust emission: high optical depth

Manual:

cd run_therm_1
ipython --matplotlib
%run problem_session

Same for the other runs

You can speed things up by adding setthreads 4 to the radmc3d command
in the problem_session.py (just uncomment the appropriate line).

Note that the results that I got are shown in the plot 
dust_temperature_comparison.png in each of these directories.
