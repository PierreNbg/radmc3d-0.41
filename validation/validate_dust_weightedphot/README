Here I test RADMC-3D dust continuum thermal Monte Carlo with weighted
photons mode and compare it against the unweighted photons mode. In 
the unweighted photon mode the brighter sources will launch more photon
packages than the less bright ones. In the weighted photon mode, each
source emits an equal number of photon packages, but these photon
packages have then different energies to compensate this.

Manual:

cd run_1
ipython --matplotlib
%run problem_session

Same for run_2

You can speed things up by adding setthreads 4 to the radmc3d command
in the problem_session.py (just uncomment the appropriate line).

Note that the results that I got are shown in the plot 
dust_temperature_comparison.png in each of these directories.
