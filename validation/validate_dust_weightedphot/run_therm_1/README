Here we make a simple model with two stars: one bright one and one less
bright. The model is optically thin. We test both the weighted photon
method and the unweighted photon method.  Both results appear to be
correct. Also overplotted are the optically thin dust temperatures as
calculated directly from python using the subroutines in the file
solvetdust.py. These temperatures are for each star individually.
