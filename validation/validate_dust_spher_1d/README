Here I test RADMC-3D for dust without scattering against the TRANSPHERE 
code I wrote many years ago. The TRANSPHERE code is in src_transphere/
which is copied from 

  ~/science/prog/transphere/PUBLICDOMAIN/playdirectory/src

The original setup of this 1-D model was made in

  ~/science/prog/transphere/PUBLICDOMAIN/playdirectory/radmc3d_run_spher1d_1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manual:

cd src_transphere
make
cd ../
cd run_1
ipython --matplotlib
%run problem_session

This should produce two plots:

 figure 1: The dust temperature of TRANSPHERE and of RADMC-3D overplotted

 figure 2: The SED of TRANSPHERE and of RADMC-3D overplotted

The match is good. Only at the very inner edge the two temperatures 
deviate a bit. And only between 3 and 8 micron the two SEDs deviate
a bit. But these differences are relatively small and are presumably
related to the slight differences in the temperature at the inner
edge.
