Similar setup as run_simple_1. But now we demonstrate the polarized thermal
emission from aligned grains. This setup only exists in python.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: The alignment asymmetry of the dust opacities (as given in
   dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp) are PURELY FICTIONAL in this example. To do
   it right, you would have to use e.g. a T-matrix code to compute the
   absorption opacity of an oblate grain as seen from the various angles. We
   assuming it is perfectly aligned with the directional field.

To run this example:

   python problem_setup.py
   radmc3d mctherm
   radmc3d image lambda 0.4e3 theta 45 phi 45

   ipython --matplotlib
   %run problem_plot
