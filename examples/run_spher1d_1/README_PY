This is a simple 1-D spherical envelope model.

NOTE: Dust scattering is switched off in this model. But this can easily
      be switched back on (see scattering_mode_max in problem_setup.py).

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README                         (This file)
  Makefile                       (Only for convenient cleanmodel and cleanall)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.py               (a python script for setting up some input files)

This is what the model does:

  It puts a spherical envelope of dust around a star and computes the
  temperature structure of the envelope. You can then make spectra and
  images.

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Make sure you have compiled the main radmc3d code in src/ already.
     See manual for how to compile.
  2) Type python problem_setup.py in the linux/unix shell. This should
     set up your model. You need, of course, a working installation of
     python 2.7 on your system.
  3) In the shell type:

      radmc3d mctherm
      radmc3d sed
      radmc3d image lambda 10

     The first command will compute the self-consistent dust temperature.
     The second command will compute the spectral energy distribution (spectrum).
     The third command will make an image at 10 micron.
  4) Now you can make plots. For example, type ipython --matplotlib
     to go into python.
  5) Then type %run plot_session
     This should produce three plots. One for the dust temperature as a
     function of radius. One for the SED. One of the image at 10 micron.
