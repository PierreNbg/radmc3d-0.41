This example shows how to make line channel maps of a protoplanetary disk.

This is a version of run_ppdisk_simple_1 . See the README_PY of that model
directory for further details about the disk model.

Here we make a channel map of CO 2-1 emission. The molecular data file is
molecule_co.inp, which is taken from the LAMDA database of Leiden. 

We switch off scattering of dust, to make smoother maps (no MC noise other than
that of the dust temperature). See radmc3d.inp "scattering_mode_max = 0" line.

We take the gas temperature to be equal to the dust temperature. See radmc3d.inp
"tgas_eq_tdust = 1" line.

To run this example:

  python problem_setup.py
  radmc3d mctherm

Then go into ipython and

  %run problem_plotexamples.py

If all goes well, radmc3d will be automatically called to make a channel map at
velocity 1.5 km/s. This shows the usual "ear" shaped emission on the right side
of the image. The "ear" is open because of the edge of the disk. The "ear" is
optically thick (i.e. the CO line is optically thick). The midplane is a bit
cooler than the surface, and hence the top and bottom of the "ear" are brighter
than the midplane region.
